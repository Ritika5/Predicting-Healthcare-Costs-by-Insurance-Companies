Created this notebook as part of - 'Python: Working with Predictive Analytics'  course - on LinkedIn Learning

Check out this notebook for a quick recap on exploring Predictive Analytics in Python. The notebook illustrates usage of some common python libraries to get started. Missing values in the dataset are identified and treated, followed by visualization of data to understand the variables. Next, categorical variables are converted to numerical ones using sklearn - label and one hot encoding. This is followed by splitting the dataset in train and test sets. Feature scaling is performed before diving in model creation.

Predictive models explored - Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression. The models are evaluated based on their R-squared value. Hyperparameter Optimization is carried out to further refine the model.
